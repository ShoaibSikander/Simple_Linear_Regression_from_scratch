# Simple_Linear_Regression_from_scratch

The purpose of this repository is to provide general understanding of how actually Linear Regression Algorithm is working. I have provided a Jupyter Notebook File and a separate Python File. Jupyter Notebook File contains explainiation of each and every step. Therefore, if you want to get understanding of line by line execution, then please follow Jupyter Notebook. The same code is implemented in a separate Python File but without any explanation and extra lines which are added in Jupyter Notebook just for understanding.

The Dataset being used has beed provided in this repository. There are only two features in this dataset which are "Head Size" and "Brain Weight". As apparent from the name, it consists of Head Size and Brain Weight of different people.

Finally, results obtained using scratch Python implementation are compared with the results obtained using Scikit-Learn Library. Getting exactly same results is the proof of correct implementation of Linear Regression using scratch Python.
